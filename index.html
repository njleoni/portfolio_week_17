                I grew up in northern Minnesota being cold and playing
                ice-hockey. I have been in Colorado for the better part of
                sixteen years with a short stint in California and then a year
                living in Australia. I have always been drawn to Colorado even
                before I had ever been here because of the mountains and I can't
                seem to leave them.

                My previous education consists of a two-year technical college
                program with an emphasis on process control and automation.
                Growing up in an iron ore mining town, this education was well
                suited for a career in the mines. The education was a great base
                as it got me into the postition I am today.

                I have been with my current company for eleven years now where I
                am the Manager of Software Implementation for three software
                deployment teams. In my position, I work closely with the
                developers of the software and am using this bootcamp class to
                gain more knowldge into their world to better communicate about
                the software we deploy.

                Aside from my day job, I have been intrigued by coding for some
                time now as I see the opportunities with having the ability to code.
                I've had a number of ideas over the years and now I can apply my 
                new skills towards those ideas that have been in my mind for some time.
